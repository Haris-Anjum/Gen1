See Beyond the Fake, Trust Whatâ€™s Real!


The rapid advancement of AI-generated video technologies, particularly deepfakes, has created unprecedented opportunities across various sectors, including entertainment, education, and art. However, the malicious use of deepfake videos has raised alarming concerns about their potential to disrupt political stability, erode social trust, and damage individual reputations. Deepfake content is increasingly used in disinformation campaigns, political manipulation, and even legal scenarios where it can falsify evidence. As video manipulation techniques become more sophisticated, distinguishing between real and manipulated content has become a significant challenge, especially given the dynamic and temporal nature of video data. Current detection systems focus primarily on AI-generated images or basic facial manipulations, often failing to account for the complexities inherent in video content.
To address these challenges, we propose a robust detection system that leverages spatial and temporal analysis techniques alongside feature-stacking mechanisms. This system is designed to accurately identify and flag AI-generated or deepfake videos by analyzing both the static and dynamic elements within video frames. The automated detection process not only flags potential deepfakes but also generates detailed reports to assist in further investigations. By providing a comprehensive solution, our system aims to mitigate the large-scale social, political, and economic impacts of deepfake misuse, contributing to a more secure digital environment.
